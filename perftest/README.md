# perftest

Extremely simple performance test to exercise calling a function 5000 times. The function implementation is just a simple random number generator.

The sheet `exercise.xlsx` contains 5000 rows. Change the seed cell to recalculate. This workbook will work for both the luau and Python variants, but not at the same time of course.
