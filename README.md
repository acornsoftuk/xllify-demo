# xllify-demo

This repo demonstrates using [xllify.com](https://xllify.com) by implementing some simple custom functions in Luau. The xllify service handles the build and packaging process. An .xll file for Windows Excel is attached when a release is created in this repo.

A good way to get started is to [fork this repo](https://github.com/acornsoftuk/xllify-demo/fork) (remember to enable actions in your fork.)

To test out your scripts before building (advisable), either use the [online editor](https://app.xllify.com/editor) or the [local environment](https://github.com/acornsoftuk/xllify-local).

For more information about the action, see https://github.com/acornsoftuk/xllify-build or the workflow in this repo.

For comprehensive documentation of all available functions, see [DOCS.md](./DOCS.md). Note that xllifyAI wrote some of this code so best not to use these for anything other than an illustration, unless of course you know what you're doing.

After downloading and installing from the [releases page](https://github.com/acornsoftuk/xllify-demo/releases/latest), Excel should show the shiny new functions.
