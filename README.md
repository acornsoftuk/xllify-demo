# xllify-demo

This repo demonstrates using [xllify.com](https://xllify.com) by implementing some simple custom functions in Luau. The xllify service handles the build and packaging process. An .xll file for Windows Excel is attached when a release is created in this repo.

A good way to get started is to [fork this repo](https://github.com/acornsoftuk/xllify-demo/fork) (remember to enable actions in your fork.)

For more information about the action, see https://github.com/acornsoftuk/xllify-build or the workflow in this repo.

After downloading and installing from the [releases page](https://github.com/acornsoftuk/xllify-demo/releases/latest), Excel should show these shiny new functions.
